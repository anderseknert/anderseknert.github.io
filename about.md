I'm Anders and I like to think, talk and code - and I'm hoping to use this page to reflect some of that.

Currently working as a developer advocate for Bisnode, and have worked in software in various positions and companies throughout the years. My primary focus within the industry has been identity systems, authentication, authorization and all things related.
