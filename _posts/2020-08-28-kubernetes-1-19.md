Kubernetes 1.19 just released, with a [fix](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91745) for an annoying [bug](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/87369) encountered at Bisnode contributed by yours truly. The fix itself is something like 3(!) lines of code - yet, managing to reproduce it reliably - and writing extensive tests to trigger that condition - took weeks of both effort and conversations back and forth with the kubernetes maintainers. Good thing I'm not paid per line of code produced, or I'd probably be the worst paid programmer in the industry.
