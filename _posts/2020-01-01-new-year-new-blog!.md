So, the twenties are finally back! And what better way to start a decade than to try and kickstart that late new years
resolution about blogging? Not that it was something I came up with just as the new year approached us - I had started
looking at a platform for blogging some months ago already but other things got in the way. Oh well.

From a tech perspective this blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted as a
"[GitHub Pages](https://github.com/anderseknert/anderseknert.github.io)" page - pretty much just markdown files and some
stylesheets that Jekyll is kind enough to transform into something resembling a blog. The (ruby based) tech behind it is
old and uninteresting enough that I might just get time for writing rather than trying to hack the actual blogging
software, something that has stopped at least a handful of previous attempts to start blogging.

About Jekyll being old - I was especially amused by the documentation section on
[creating posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-posts) where the example post is named
"2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md" - that's almost a decade ago now! Just as GitHub repositories with a
"last modified" dating a few years back in time, that would have been a huge warning flag to me had you asked me just
a few years ago. Now I consider "slow moving, old and boring" a feature, at least for software like this where it's
not the actual code itself that's of interest but rather something I approach as an end user.

Hoping to focus on writing down my thoughts rather than coding the blog itself, but given this is all very new there
_are_ a few things that I'll need to look into before I can do so:

* Should poke around in themes and stylesheets and pick a theme for the blog as the minima theme certainly was minimal.
* Analytics. There's Google Analytics of course, but I'd rather use something that respects user privacy, doesn't do
tracking outside of the blog, etc. Piwik/Matomo seems to be a contender here, but not sure yet how to use it with a statically
generated blog.
* Setup something for post comments. Unsurprisingly this is a little trickier to pull off on a statically generated site. [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) seemed to have ruled this space for long, but their popularity has declined since they introduced (allegedly, annoying) ads in their free model. [Staticman](https://staticman.net/docs/) seems to be a great free alternative - will check it out as soon as possible.

<p></p>
Will look into my options for any of the above as soon as I get an opportunity to do so, and perhaps I'll write some
about it here as well. For now just happy to finally get something out the door!
